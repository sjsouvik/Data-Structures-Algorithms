/*
Given K sorted lists of integers of size N each, find the smallest range that includes at least one element from each of the K lists. If more than one 
such range's are found, find the first such range found.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5, K = 3
KSortedArray[][] = {{1 3 5 7 9},
                    {0 2 4 6 8},
                    {2 3 5 7 11}}
Output: 1 2
Explanation: K = 3
A:[1 3 5 7 9]
B:[0 2 4 6 8]
C:[2 3 5 7 11]
Smallest range is formed by number 1
present in first list and 2 is present
in both 2nd and 3rd list.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4, K = 3
KSortedArray[][] = {{1 2 3 4},
                    {5 6 7 8},
                    {9 10 11 12}}
Output: 4 9

Your Task :

Complete the function findSmallestRange() that receives array , array size n and k as parameters and returns the output range (as a pair<int,int> in 
cpp and array of size 2 in java and python)

Expected Time Complexity : O(n * k *log k)
Expected Auxilliary Space  : O(k)

Constraints:
1 <= K,N <= 500

    The time complexity of heap based solution is O(Nk Log k).
    
    The algorithm for the solution is as following:
    
    1. Create a min heap of size k and insert first elements of all k lists into the heap.
    2. Maintain two variables min and max to store minimum and maximum values present in the heap at any point. Note min will always contain value of the root of the heap.
    3. Repeat following steps
        i) Get the minimum element from the heap (minimum is always at root) and compute the range.
        ii) Replace heap root with next element of the list from which the min element is extracted. After replacing the root, heapify the tree. Update max if next element is greater. If the list doesnâ€™t have any more elements, break the loop.
